ABOUT THE APP
-Problem: I am an admin that has too many vacancies and applicants that I need to keep track of.
-General App Idea/Purpose: An app that allows me to post vacancies that people can apply for and store the applicants information.
-Who Would Use It: Admin or recruiters of a company.

FEATURES OF THE APP (MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT) ACHIEVED:
-A working full-stack application, built by you, using Node.js, Mongoose, Express and EJS
-Adhere to the MVC file structure: Models, Views, Controllers
-RESTful routes and full CRUD.

STRETCH GOALS ACHIEVED:
-Include sign up/log in functionality, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow
-Use a CSS framework like Skeleton or Bootstrap

DETAILS OF THE APPLICATION
A. Explanations of the technologies used (technical details)
In this app, Node.js, Mongoose, Express and EJS was used. The data was stored in MongoDB Atlas. The CSS framework Bootstrap was used and sign up and login functionality using Passport was done.

B. The approach taken
In Day 1, I planned the wireframe of the application and started to set up the required back end technologies(ejs, passport, express, etc).

In Day 2, I completed the login and register functions and managed to get the vacancies to show on the home page and admin dashboards.

In Day 3, I added the create vacancy, view applicants functions for the admin. Also, got started for the edit and delete vacancy functions.

In Day 4, I completed the edit and delete vacancy functions. In the evening I wanted to add the search function but encountered a bug I could not solve.

C. Unsolved problems / Improvements
Search function for jobs was not able to be completed due to a bug. Future improvements can add the search functions for the vacancies so that the applicant can easily search for the vacancy that they are interested in, instead of scrolling one by one.

D. User Stories
-The Admin would be able to create new vacancy, view candidate list, update vacancy details and delete vacancies.
-The Candidate/Applicant would be able to view vacancies, create new application and upload resume.

E. The technical challenges and one new thing learned during this project
-I struggled through the technical challenge to understand the syntax for back end technologies such as mongoose and mongoDB. I learned to familiarise myself with reading documentation for new technologies this way and have better planning skills before coding a project.
